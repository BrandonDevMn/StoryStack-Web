# StoryShelf Web App Specification

## Overview

Build a Progressive Web App (PWA) called **StoryShelf** using vanilla HTML + JavaScript, optimized for iPads and iPhones, that randomly selects books from a "to be read" (TBR) list. The app should be installable on mobile devices and work as a standalone application.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Write simple, easy to read, well-commented code
- Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries)
- Ensure code is self-documenting with clear variable and function names

## Core Functionality

### File Structure
- **Entry point:** `index.html`
- **App icon:** `icon.jpg` (expected to be present)
- Include `manifest.json` for PWA functionality
- Include `sw.js` (service worker) for offline support

### iOS PWA Requirements
- Support iOS "Add to Home Screen" functionality
- Include proper meta tags for iOS Safari
- Ensure responsive design for iPad and iPhone
- Handle iOS safe areas and notches

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Bottom Navigation:** Always include tabs at the bottom of the screen
- **Left Tab:** Main function of the app (primary feature) - Picker Tab (üìö)
- **Right Tab:** About tab (app information, version, etc.) - About Tab (‚ÑπÔ∏è)
- **Middle Tabs:** Additional features as needed
- Design should be touch-friendly with appropriate tap targets
- Follow iOS design patterns and conventions

### Technical Specifications
- Viewport meta tag optimized for iOS
- Apple-specific meta tags for PWA behavior
- Touch icon declarations
- Service worker for caching and offline functionality
- Responsive CSS for various iOS device sizes

### Tab Navigation System

- **Two-tab interface** with bottom navigation
- **Picker Tab** (üìö) - Contains all book selection functionality (default active)
- **About Tab** (‚ÑπÔ∏è) - Contains app information, source code link, and attribution
- **Touch-friendly tab buttons** with smooth transitions
- **Active state indicators** for current tab selection

### Input Processing

- Accept a list of books from the user via a textarea
- Split the text on newline characters (`\n`)
- Filter out empty lines (lines with only whitespace)
- Count the total number of books in the TBR list

### Random Selection

- Generate random numbers within the range of available books
- Select 3 different books for:
1. **Next Read** (priority book)
1. **Backup Choice** (secondary option)
1. **Alternative Pick** (third option)
- Ensure no duplicate selections (same book can‚Äôt be selected multiple times)

### Display Results

- Show the three selected books with clear visual hierarchy
- Use color-coded sections: green (Next Read), orange (Backup Choice), blue (Alternative Pick)
- Display them in priority order with descriptive labels
- Include a ‚ÄúPick Again‚Äù button to generate new random selections from the same TBR list

## Technical Requirements

1. User adds StoryShelf to home screen for easy access
1. User opens StoryShelf as standalone app
1. User pastes or types their to-be-read list (one book per line)
1. User taps ‚ÄúPick My Next Books‚Äù button
1. App displays three prioritized book selections with visual hierarchy
1. User can tap ‚ÄúPick Again‚Äù to explore different combinations
1. User can return to app anytime via home screen icon

## Code Organization

### HTML Structure

- Semantic markup with proper accessibility considerations
- Clear section divisions for different app areas
- Proper form elements and labeling

### CSS Organization

- Reset and base styles
- Component-specific styling with clear comments
- Responsive design patterns
- Animation and transition definitions
- Mobile-optimized touch targets

### JavaScript Functions

- Verify random selection algorithm prevents duplicates
- Test error handling and recovery

### Mobile Testing

- Test on both iPhone and iPad in different orientations
- Verify touch interactions work smoothly across different screen sizes
- Test PWA installation process on iOS and Android
- Verify standalone mode functionality

- **Smooth animations** - 60fps transitions where possible
- **Responsive interactions** - Immediate feedback for user actions
- **Efficient random selection** - Handle lists of 100+ books smoothly
- **Memory efficient** - Minimal resource usage for mobile devices

## Book-Specific Features

### Input Enhancements

- Placeholder text with realistic book title examples
- Support for various title formats:
  - ‚ÄúBook Title by Author Name‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúSeries Name #1: Book Title‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúBook Title (Series Name Book 1)‚Äù
  - Just ‚ÄúBook Title‚Äù

### Display Enhancements

- Encourage exploration of different book combinations

## Additional Notes

- Keep the codebase maintainable and well-documented
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended)
- Include brief comments explaining main logic blocks
- Ensure app works completely offline after initial load
- Design with reading enthusiasts in mind - the goal is helping people decide what to read next
- Consider the emotional aspect: users often feel overwhelmed by choice, so provide clear guidance
- Make the experience feel personal and encouraging rather than purely random

## Future Enhancement Considerations

While not required for initial implementation, consider these potential features:

- Local storage to remember recent book lists
- Reading progress tracking
- Book cover integration
- Goodreads API integration
- Reading goal features
- Social sharing of book picks

## Browser Support

- iOS Safari 12+
- Chrome Mobile 70+
- Samsung Internet 10+
- Focus on modern mobile browsers with PWA support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers (still functional, just not installable)

## Implementation Notes

When implementing this spec, ensure the app works seamlessly on iOS devices and can be added to the home screen for a native-like experience. Follow iOS design patterns and conventions throughout the application to provide users with a familiar interface that feels natural on their devices.
